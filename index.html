    <h1>The Relationship between Pollution and Economic Activity</h1>

        In this study, I aim to replicate and extend the findings of Vandenbroucke and Zhu (2017) from their work 
        <strong>Measures of Pollution</strong>. Their research explored the relationship between economic activity, measured 
        by GDP per capita, and air pollution, specifically PM2.5 and CO2 emissions. Using a new dataset—the WMO SDS-WAS Global 
        Dust Reanalysis Ensemble spanning 2003 to 2022—I seek to examine whether the patterns observed in their study hold true 
        with higher spatial and temporal resolution data. This replication allows for a validation of their findings and provides 
        an updated analysis using contemporary datasets.
